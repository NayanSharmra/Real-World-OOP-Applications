# Expense Tracker Application

## Overview
The **Expense Tracker Application** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool developed as part of the mid-course project at Fynd Academy. This application allows users to manage and categorize their daily expenses efficiently. It utilizes core Python concepts such as object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling with CSV, and data persistence to offer a simple yet effective way to track, analyze, and report expenses.

## Features
- **Add, Categorize, Update, View, and Delete Expenses**: Manage your expenses with ease.
- **Expense Filtering**: Filter expenses by categories for better analysis.
- **Generate Reports**: Generate expense reports for specific time periods (daily, weekly, monthly).
- **Data Persistence**: Expenses are saved in CSV files for data persistence.

## Objectives
- Provide a user-friendly CLI for expense management.
- Enable expense categorization and filtering.
- Allow generation of custom reports based on time periods.
- Ensure data is saved and can be loaded across sessions using CSV files.

## Setup Instructions

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment for the project, run the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

This will create a virtual environment named `venv`. You can now proceed to activate the environment and install the necessary dependencies as described in the rest of the setup instructions.

### 4. Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. Run the Application
To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
